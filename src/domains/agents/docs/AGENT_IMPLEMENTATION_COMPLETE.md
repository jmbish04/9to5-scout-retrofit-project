## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **BaseAgent Architecture**

```typescript
export abstract class BaseAgent extends Agent {
  protected env: Env;
  protected agentName: string;
  protected _state: BaseAgentState;

  // Common functionality for all agents
  async callWorkersAI(model: string, prompt: string, options: any);
  async callWorkersAIStructured(model: string, prompt: string, schema: any);
  async logActivity(activity: string, data: any, level: string);
  async storeData(key: string, data: any);
  async getData(key: string);
  async scheduleTask(when: number | Date | string, callback: string, data: any);
}
```

### **Agent State Management**

```typescript
export interface BaseAgentState {
  status: "idle" | "processing" | "error" | "completed";
  lastActivity: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  errorCount: number;
  successCount: number;
}
