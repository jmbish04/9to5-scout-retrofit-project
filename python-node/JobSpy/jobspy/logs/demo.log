We’re seeking a Principal Solutions Architect who combines deep hands-on technical expertise with the ability to build scalable mechanisms that amplify the effectiveness of our Startup Solutions Architecture team.  
  
This role requires a rare blend of builder’s depth and strategic impact: "someone who can still design", code, and operate systems at scale, while also creating programs, frameworks, and reusable assets that multiply impact across hundreds of startups.  
  
Why This Role  
  
At AWS, we’re looking for builders who scale impact. The successful candidate will combine: "* Deep technical expertise (still hands-on)
* Scalable mechanism design (programs", frameworks, enablement)
* Startup empathy (credible in front of developers and co-founders)
* AI/data native perspective (helping startups turn data into their moat)

  
This role offers the chance to shape how AWS engages startups at scale — while working at the frontier of cloud + data + AI innovation.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
Technical Leadership & Mechanism Building  

* Design and implement scalable programs, reusable assets, and automation tools that amplify the impact of the Startup SA org.
* Create reference architectures, IaC templates, and enablement content to accelerate solution delivery across startups.
* Develop systematic approaches to capture, codify, and share technical insights from the field back into the org.
* Mentor SAs and drive technical upskilling programs that elevate the entire team’s capabilities.

  
Domain Expertise & Hands-on Impact  
Principal SAs for Startups should have depth and expertise in one of the following technical domains, but the technical curiosity to become proficient in all: "* ML/AI Infrastructure:
* Architect training and inference systems at scale (distributed training", LoRA/QLoRA, quantization, GPU/TPU optimization).
* Design end-to-end ML pipelines and MLOps workflows (data prep, labeling, model registry, deployment).
* Build and optimize model serving architectures and inference systems for cost and latency.
* Cloud Native & Kubernetes: "* Lead design and ops excellence for Kubernetes/EKS", service mesh, microservices, and serverless-first architectures.
* Ensure security, compliance, and observability in containerized workloads.
* DevOps & Reliability: "* Drive GitOps-first workflows", CI/CD at scale, IaC (Terraform/CDK), and automated testing frameworks.
* Apply SRE best practices: "monitoring", incident management, resilience, and scaling patterns.
* Data Strategy & Foundations: "* Advise startups on proprietary data strategy as a moat: collection", quality, labeling, governance.
* Architect data pipelines (ETL/ELT, streaming, orchestration) and integrate with modern analytics platforms (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Databricks).
* Guide adoption of feature stores, vector databases, and lakehouse patterns to enable ML/RAG use cases.
* Ensure compliance and governance across sensitive workloads (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2).

  
Technical Trend Analysis & Strategic Impact  

* Maintain deep understanding of emerging technical trends in GenAI, cloud, and data ecosystems.
* Translate insights into actionable guidance for startups and scalable mechanisms for the org.
* Provide forward-looking perspectives on technology adoption, evolution, and competitive advantage.

  
Scaling & Developer Enablement  

* Build repeatable solutions and reference architectures addressing common startup pain points.
* Publish blogs, whitepapers, open-source repos, and technical presentations that extend reach beyond direct engagements.
* Act as a “co-founder whisperer” — translating complex technical trade-offs into pragmatic startup-stage guidance.",

* Apply SRE best practices: "monitoring", incident management, resilience, and scaling patterns.
* Data Strategy & Foundations: "* Advise startups on proprietary data strategy as a moat: collection", quality, labeling, governance.
* Architect data pipelines (ETL/ELT, streaming, orchestration) and integrate with modern analytics platforms (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Databricks).
* Guide adoption of feature stores, vector databases, and lakehouse patterns to enable ML/RAG use cases.
* Ensure compliance and governance across sensitive workloads (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2).

  
Technical Trend Analysis & Strategic Impact  

* Maintain deep understanding of emerging technical trends in GenAI, cloud, and data ecosystems.
* Translate insights into actionable guidance for startups and scalable mechanisms for the org.
* Provide forward-looking perspectives on technology adoption, evolution, and competitive advantage.

  
Scaling & Developer Enablement  

* Build repeatable solutions and reference architectures addressing common startup pain points.
* Publish blogs, whitepapers, open-source repos, and technical presentations that extend reach beyond direct engagements.
* Act as a “co-founder whisperer” — translating complex technical trade-offs into pragmatic startup-stage guidance.",

  "job_description": "**DESCRIPTION**
---------------

We’re seeking a Principal Solutions Architect who combines deep hands-on technical expertise with the ability to build scalable mechanisms that amplify the effectiveness of our Startup Solutions Architecture team.  
  
This role requires a rare blend of builder’s depth and strategic impact: someone who can still design, code, and operate systems at scale, while also creating programs, frameworks, and reusable assets that multiply impact across hundreds of startups.  
  
Why This Role  
  
At AWS, we’re looking for builders who scale impact. The successful candidate will combine:  
  

* Deep technical expertise (still hands-on)
* Scalable mechanism design (programs, frameworks, enablement)
* Startup empathy (credible in front of developers and co-founders)
* AI/data native perspective (helping startups turn data into their moat)

  
This role offers the chance to shape how AWS engages startups at scale — while working at the frontier of cloud + data + AI innovation.  
  
Key job responsibilities  
Technical Leadership & Mechanism Building  

* Design and implement scalable programs, reusable assets, and automation tools that amplify the impact of the Startup SA org.
* Create reference architectures, IaC templates, and enablement content to accelerate solution delivery across startups.
* Develop systematic approaches to capture, codify, and share technical insights from the field back into the org.
* Mentor SAs and drive technical upskilling programs that elevate the entire team’s capabilities.

  
Domain Expertise & Hands-on Impact  
Principal SAs for Startups should have depth and expertise in one of the following technical domains, but the technical curiosity to become proficient in all:  

* ML/AI Infrastructure:
* Architect training and inference systems at scale (distributed training, LoRA/QLoRA, quantization, GPU/TPU optimization).
* Design end-to-end ML pipelines and MLOps workflows (data prep, labeling, model registry, deployment).
* Build and optimize model serving architectures and inference systems for cost and latency.

* Design end-to-end ML pipelines and MLOps workflows (data prep, labeling, model registry, deployment).
* Build and optimize model serving architectures and inference systems for cost and latency.
* Cloud Native & Kubernetes:
* Lead design and ops excellence for Kubernetes/EKS, service mesh, microservices, and serverless-first architectures.
* Ensure security, compliance, and observability in containerized workloads.
* DevOps & Reliability:
* Drive GitOps-first workflows, CI/CD at scale, IaC (Terraform/CDK), and automated testing frameworks.
* Apply SRE best practices: monitoring, incident management, resilience, and scaling patterns.
* Data Strategy & Foundations:
* Advise startups on proprietary data strategy as a moat: collection, quality, labeling, governance.
* Architect data pipelines (ETL/ELT, streaming, orchestration) and integrate with modern analytics platforms (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, Databricks).
* Guide adoption of feature stores, vector databases, and lakehouse patterns to enable ML/RAG use cases.
* Ensure compliance and governance across sensitive workloads (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2).

  
Technical Trend Analysis & Strategic Impact  

* Maintain deep understanding of emerging technical trends in GenAI, cloud, and data ecosystems.
* Translate insights into actionable guidance for startups and scalable mechanisms for the org.
* Provide forward-looking perspectives on technology adoption, evolution, and competitive advantage.

Global Business Partnering (GBP) is GREF's direct link to Amazon’s senior leadership for location strategy, defect resolution, and executive reporting/planning; this direct link enables GREF’s corporate real estate solutions to be properly aligned with the unique objectives of each business org. Amazon businesses are co-owners of the company's real estate portfolio. Business Partners are their leader's trusted advisors, focused on optimizing our real estate portfolio to enable the highest levels of employee productivity. Amazon’s Day 1 culture and focus on frugality requires that we prioritize the most efficient real estate solutions, preserving Amazon capital for programs that drive innovation on behalf of Amazon's customers. Each OL2/3 leader has a Finance partner and a PXT partner who advises, informs, supports, and participates in long-range planning. GBP provides a GREF partner in the same way. GBP connects GREF's operating plan to the business orgs' operating plans.  
  
As a Sr. Manager on GREF’s Business Partnering team, this role serves as the lead business partner (BP) for the G&A organizations, working with the org's senior leaders. Amazon’s G&A orgs include Finance, HR, PR, Legal, and Security. This role is the G&A org’s lead point of contact for all GREF matters, like G&A’s lead Finance executive for all G&A Finance matters. This role’s primary objectives are to increase controllership, frugality, efficiency, and operational planning integration between GREF and G&A leadership. They track the metrics and qualitative evidence that measure the success of those objectives (i.e., QBRs). They use data and facts to address concerns around expense, speed, and flexibility. They bridge the operating plans of G&A and GREF, driving real estate strategies that support business objectives. They serve as the single point of contact (POC) for each business’ leadership (OL2/3), addressing and resolving their needs across all GREF functions, analogous to a Finance VP / Director or HR business partner. To support senior leaders’ real estate planning, the team partners with other leaders across HR, Finance, PR, Public Policy, Protective Services, Information Security, and Economic Development.  
  
Key job responsibilities  

* Partner across enterprise partners (e.g., Finance, HR, PR, Legal, Security, etc.), all cross-functional GREF real estate teams, and Corporate FP&A to support executive leaders in managing through ambiguity while inspecting and understanding the consequences of choices and trade-offs.
* Build systems and tracking mechanisms to deliver agreed upon SLAs.
* Establish rhythm of business for each org, integrating GREF into business-level OP1/OP2 planning process and WBR/MBR/QBR cadence.
* Implement reporting mechanisms to support G&A’s leaders with data, analytics, metrics and research to make the best decisions.
* Balance G&A’s expectations and needs with Amazon fiduciary stewardship, as well as cost savings mandates and GREF standards/protocols.
* Lead and support the development and delivery of S-team executive-level real estate presentations, recommendations, and business cases; incorporate input from GREF teams to secure decisions and alignment for those presentations.
* Oversee issue escalation processes.
* Partner with GREF teams and external stakeholders to drive the successful development, implementation, and execution of GREF strategies across organizations and regions.
