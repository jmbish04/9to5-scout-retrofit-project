# Phase 12 Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

The modularization is **NOT complete** despite previous reports. This guide provides immediate steps to begin the completion process.

---

## **CURRENT STATUS**

- **Completion Rate**: ~60-70%
- **Remaining Work**: 30+ files still in `src/lib/` and `src/routes/`
- **Build Status**: âœ… Building successfully (but with technical debt)
- **Priority**: Complete high-priority migrations first

---

## **STEP 1: START WITH HIGHEST IMPACT FILES**

### **Immediate Priority (Next 2-4 hours)**

1. **`src/lib/documents.ts` (922 lines)**

   ```bash
   # Create target directory
   mkdir -p src/domains/documents/services

   # Move and split the file
   # This is the largest file and will have the biggest impact
   ```

2. **`src/lib/storage.ts` (811 lines)**

   ```bash
   # This file needs to be split across multiple domains
   # It contains job, site, applicant, and company storage logic
   ```

3. **`src/lib/browser-rendering.ts` (688 lines)**

   ```bash
   # Move to integrations/browser/
   # Split into browser-rendering.service.ts and browser-testing.service.ts
   ```

4. **`src/lib/openapi.ts` (701 lines)**
   ```bash
   # Move to src/api/
   # Split into openapi-generator.ts, openapi-routes.ts, openapi-schemas.ts
   ```

---

## **STEP 2: MIGRATION PROCESS**

### **For Each File Migration:**

1. **Create Target Directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/domains/{domain}/services
   # or
   mkdir -p src/integrations/{service}/
   ```

2. **Move and Split File**

   ```bash
   # Move the file
   mv src/lib/filename.ts src/domains/domain/services/filename.service.ts

   # Split large files into focused modules
   # Each service should have a single responsibility
   ```

3. **Update Imports in Moved File**

   ```bash
   # Update relative imports in the moved file
   # Change ../lib/ imports to ../../lib/ or appropriate paths
   ```

4. **Search and Replace All References**

   ```bash
   # Find all files that import the moved file
   grep -r "from.*lib/filename" src/

   # Update each reference to use the new path
   # Use your IDE's find/replace functionality
   ```

5. **Test Build**

   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   # Fix any TypeScript errors
   ```

6. **Test Functionality**
   ```bash
   # Test the specific functionality that was moved
   # Ensure no behavior changes
   ```

---

## **STEP 3: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **After Each Migration:**

- [ ] File moved to correct domain location
- [ ] File split into focused modules (if large)
- [ ] All imports in moved file updated
- [ ] All references throughout codebase updated
- [ ] Build successful (`pnpm run build`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Functionality tested and working
- [ ] Legacy compatibility maintained

---

## **STEP 4: PRIORITY ORDER**

### **Week 1: High-Priority Files**

**Day 1-2: Critical Lib Files**

- [ ] `src/lib/documents.ts` (922 lines)
- [ ] `src/lib/storage.ts` (811 lines)
- [ ] `src/lib/browser-rendering.ts` (688 lines)
- [ ] `src/lib/openapi.ts` (701 lines)

**Day 3-4: Critical Route Files**

- [ ] `src/routes/api.ts` (694 lines)
- [ ] `src/routes/webhooks.ts`
- [ ] `src/routes/files.ts`

**Day 5-7: Medium-Priority Lib Files**

- [ ] `src/lib/ai.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/agents.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/monitoring.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/embeddings.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/talent.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/crawl.ts`
- [ ] `src/lib/job-processing.ts`

### **Week 2: Remaining Files**

**Day 1-3: Remaining Lib Files**

- [ ] All remaining files in `src/lib/` (15+ files)

**Day 4-5: Remaining Route Files**

- [ ] All remaining files in `src/routes/` (15+ files)

### **Week 3: Cleanup & Consolidation**

**Day 1-7: Final Steps**

- [ ] Import cleanup throughout codebase
- [ ] Legacy file consolidation
- [ ] Final testing and verification
- [ ] Documentation updates

---

## **STEP 5: COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue: Import Path Errors**

```bash
# Problem: Cannot find module '../lib/filename'
# Solution: Update import path to new location
# Old: import { something } from '../lib/filename'
# New: import { something } from '../domains/domain/services/filename.service'
```

### **Issue: TypeScript Compilation Errors**

```bash
# Problem: Type errors after moving files
# Solution: Update type imports and exports
# Ensure all types are properly exported from domain modules
```

### **Issue: Circular Dependencies**

```bash
# Problem: Circular import dependencies
# Solution: Restructure imports or extract shared code
# Move common types to shared/types/
```

### **Issue: Legacy Compatibility Broken**

```bash
# Problem: Legacy routes not working
# Solution: Update legacy route handlers to use new services
# Ensure backward compatibility is maintained
```

---

## **STEP 6: SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Phase 12B Completion (Week 1)**

- [ ] All high-priority files migrated
- [ ] Build successful with no errors
- [ ] All imports updated
- [ ] Functionality verified

### **Phase 12C Completion (Week 2)**

- [ ] All remaining files migrated
- [ ] No files in `src/lib/` or `src/routes/` (except legacy)
- [ ] All imports cleaned up
- [ ] All tests passing

### **Phase 12E Completion (Week 3)**

- [ ] Final consolidation complete
- [ ] Clean, modular architecture achieved
- [ ] Zero functionality loss
- [ ] Comprehensive testing completed

---

## **STEP 7: GETTING STARTED NOW**

### **Immediate Action (Next 30 minutes)**

1. **Choose First File**: Start with `src/lib/documents.ts` (largest impact)
2. **Create Target Directory**: `mkdir -p src/domains/documents/services`
3. **Begin Migration**: Move and split the file
4. **Update Imports**: Fix all references
5. **Test Build**: Ensure no errors
6. **Commit Changes**: Save progress

### **Daily Workflow**

1. **Morning**: Select 2-3 files to migrate
2. **Migration Process**: Move, split, update imports, test
3. **Afternoon**: Test functionality and fix issues
4. **Evening**: Commit changes and document progress

## **RESOURCES**

- **Detailed Plan**: `docs/todo/phase12/phase12-completion-plan-updated.md`
- **Implementation Checklist**: `docs/todo/phase12/phase12-implementation-checklist.md`
- **Original Plans**: `docs/todo/updated-modularization-plan.md`

## **CONCLUSION**

The modularization is **NOT complete** and requires immediate action. Start with the high-priority files listed above, follow the migration process, and work systematically through the remaining files. With proper testing and verification at each step, this will achieve the intended clean architecture while maintaining zero functionality loss.

**Next Step**: Begin with `src/lib/documents.ts` migration.
