# Task 5: Harden Validation, Monitoring, and Tooling for the Modular Worker

## Objective
Finalize the retrofit by establishing consistent validation, logging, and monitoring practices that ensure the modularized worker is production-ready.

## Why this matters
- Phase 12 documentation calls for comprehensive error handling, analytics, and cleanup to close out the refactor.
- Modular boundaries introduce new failure points that require cohesive validation layers and observability hooks.
- CI, type generation, and documentation updates must reflect the new architecture so future agents can operate safely.

## Implementation Steps
1. Centralize schema validation helpers in `src/core/validation/` and wire them into each domain route, ensuring OpenAPI definitions stay synchronized with runtime validation.
2. Implement structured logging and analytics hooks within domain services, integrating with any Workers Analytics Engine datasets referenced in the project guidelines.
3. Update automation scripts to run `pnpm exec wrangler types`, linting, Vitest, and integration checks after the module move to guard against regressions.
4. Refresh documentation (`AGENTS.md`, domain READMEs, operational runbooks) to describe the modular architecture, actor workflow, and monitoring expectations.
5. Remove deprecated modules and confirm the Phase 12 cleanup checklist (docs/todo/phase12/chunked_prompts/10_finalize_phase12_cleanup.md) is fully satisfied before closing the retrofit.
