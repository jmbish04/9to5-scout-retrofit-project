# Task 1: Establish core platform scaffolding

## Objective
Create the foundational project scaffolding that enables the modular worker architecture described in the updated modularization plan.

## Key Actions
- Introduce the `src/core/` hierarchy (auth, database, storage, validation) with placeholder modules that document their intended contracts.
- Generate and commit fresh Wrangler binding types (`pnpm exec wrangler types`) to guarantee Env typings remain aligned with the new module boundaries.
- Document the dependency graph between `core` and `domains` modules, emphasizing one-way imports from domains into core utilities.
- Ensure new scaffolding follows the Cloudflare Workers best practices cited in the plan (compatibility flags, nodejs_compat, browser binding declaration).

## Deliverables
- New directory structure and index files under `src/core/` ready for domain implementations.
- Updated `worker-configuration.d.ts` reflecting any added bindings.
- Architecture notes describing the intended usage patterns for core services.
