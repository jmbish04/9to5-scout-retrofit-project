# Task 5: Validate quality, documentation, and operational readiness

## Objective
Confirm the retrofitted worker meets operational requirements after modularization and actor upgrades.

## Key Actions
- Update docs (`README`, domain-specific guides, AGENTS status) to reflect the new architecture and developer workflows outlined in phase12 progress docs.
- Expand automated tests (unit, integration, workflow) to cover actor message flows, route integration, and storage adapters.
- Execute end-to-end smoke tests against FastAPI integration endpoints (`/api/v1/poll-for-jobs`, `/ws`, job status updates) to ensure compatibility is maintained.
- Capture observability signals (logging conventions, monitoring hooks) aligned with the monitoring domain plan, ensuring degraded actors can be diagnosed quickly.

## Deliverables
- Documentation updates that guide contributors through the modular worker.
- Passing automated test suite and recorded smoke test results.
- Checklist confirming FastAPI endpoints and monitoring flows remain healthy post-refactor.
