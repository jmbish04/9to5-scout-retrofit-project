- **Workers AI**: Large language models for extraction and generation
- **Browser Rendering**: Headless browser for dynamic content

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Wrangler
Update `wrangler.toml` with your specific resource IDs:
```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "JOB_SCRAPER_DB"
database_id = "your-d1-database-id"

[[kv_namespaces]]  
binding = "KV"
id = "your-kv-namespace-id"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "R2"
bucket_name = "job-scraper"

[[vectorize]]
binding = "VECTORIZE_INDEX" 
index_name = "jobs"
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# In wrangler.toml [vars] section or as secrets
API_AUTH_TOKEN = "your-secure-token"
BROWSER_RENDERING_TOKEN = "your-browser-token"  
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL = "your-slack-webhook-url"
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Local development
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply JOB_SCRAPER_DB --local

# Production  
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply JOB_SCRAPER_DB --remote
```

### 5. Deploy
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Usage

### Job Discovery & Monitoring

#### 1. Configure Job Sites
```bash
# Add a job site for crawling
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/configs \
     -d '{
       "name": "Tech Jobs", 
       "keywords": "[\"software engineer\", \"developer\", \"python\"]",
       "locations": "San Francisco, Remote",
       "include_domains": "company.com,startup.io"
     }'
```

#### 2. Start Job Discovery
```bash
# Discover new jobs across all configured sites
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/runs/discovery

# Or target a specific configuration
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/runs/discovery \
     -d '{"config_id": "your-config-id"}'
```

#### 3. Monitor Job Changes
```bash
# Start monitoring all active jobs  
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/runs/monitor
```

#### 4. Query Jobs with AI
```bash
# Semantic search for relevant jobs
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     "https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/agent/query?q=senior%20python%20developer%20remote"
```

### Career Document Generation

#### Generate Cover Letter
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/cover-letter \
     -d '{
       "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer",
       "company_name": "TechCorp Inc",
       "hiring_manager_name": "Jane Smith",
       "job_description_text": "We are seeking a senior software engineer...",

## Database Schema

The platform uses several interconnected tables:

- **sites**: Job site configurations
- **search_configs**: Search criteria and filters  
- **jobs**: Job postings with full metadata
- **snapshots**: Historical job data for change detection
- **changes**: Change analysis with AI summaries
- **runs**: Processing run tracking

## Contributing

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Use structured schemas for AI interactions
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Update documentation for new features
5. Test with local D1 database before deployment
